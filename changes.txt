for the angular.io file: 

We need to do these do changes in the angular.json file.


first select the are where we have to give like this 

 "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets"
            ],

instead of this

 "assets": [
 "glob": "**/*",
                 "input": "public",
            ],



in angular.json
