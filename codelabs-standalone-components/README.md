# Photo Gallery App - Getting started with Standalone Components and Google App Engine

In this codelab, you'll build a wildlife photo gallery app with Angular v14 and then you'll deploy it to Google App Engine. 
The completed app will display a set of photos and it will also feature a “send message” form to contact the photographer and a chat window to learn cool facts about the animals pictured in the photos. 

You'll build everything with Angular using Angular v14 and the new standalone components feature.

Here's a preview of the application:
